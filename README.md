EventFiringWebDriverExamples
============================
Current this repository
provides only one completed example,
which uses `EventFiringWebDriver`'s `ExceptionThrown` event,
as discussed in this blog article -
[Take a screenshot on exception with Selenium C#'s EventFiringWebDriver](http://yizeng.me/2014/02/08/).

However, more examples are welcome.
